                <p style="line-height: 25px; text-indent: 25%;">I am <b>RNV sundeep</b> and I am this page talks about my journey in MSIT program IIIT-Hyderabad.
                    I started my journey in <b>MSIT</b> in the month of June 2019. I left my previous organization in the month of January 2019, due to non IT sector. I wanted to
                    have a job in IT sector. I came to know about MSIT through one of my friend,who is successfully placed through MSIT, when I was looking for other 
                    options to get into IT sector. So, I started preparing for GAT(Enterence for MSIT) and appreared for exam in the month of April. 
                    I successfully cracked the exam and got a seat in MSIT. <br>
                </p>
                <p style="line-height: 25px; margin-top: 10px;">I chose MSIT because of two main reasons. <br>
                    <b>1. M.Tech degree:</b> I always wanted to do M.Tech in a well reputed college and get a master's degree. 
                    This will add weight to my resume and increase my chance of getting selected.<br>
                    <b>2. Placements:</b> MSIT provides many placement offers in top MNC's like Amazon, TCS etc. with good package. <br> 
                </p>
                <p style="line-height: 25px;margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 10px;"> After careful consideration and much thought, I chose MSIT because 
                    I would be getting a degree with good placement with good package within 1 year. What else would I need? <br>
                </p>
